# Marcos Zúñiga Ituarte — Computer Engineering Student
I’m a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at the University of A Coruña (UDC), with a strong interest in software development, systems, and modern technologies.  
I have experience working with different tools, and I enjoy exploring technologies, especially AI tools that enhance and accelerate development.

I am especially interested in participating in projects with real-world impact.

## 💼 Experience
### **HackUDC**
I have participated twice in the HackUDC hackathon, where I learned new skills, met different companies and students, and gained experience working in teams under pressure.

### **Tech Talks**
I attend technology talks and events like **HumanIA: Intelixencia artificial e transformación do emprego tradicional: retos e oportunidades** whenever possible to keep learning and to stay updated on new concepts, tools, and industry trends.

### **Mentoring**
I currently volunteer as a mentor at my faculty, helping new students adapt to the university environment and supporting them during their first year.

### **Featured Project — Llama Chama!**
A small indie game I originally developed a few years ago, where I handled every aspect of the project myself: programming, creating visual assets, and composing the music.  
Recently, I revisited and published it on GitHub to keep it available and improve its presentation.

- Fully programmed from scratch using **Unity**  
- Self-made sprites and visual art created with **GIMP**  
- Original soundtrack composed and produced in **Reaper**  
- Updated and published in 2025 on GitHub Pages
